Provides you with accurate weather data on demand.

## What's new?
- We've upgraded our system to now work on the web. The backend runs on python and the frontennd runs on html5 and javascript.
- You can now properly communicate with the system. Say good bye to that robotic feelings of /command and hello to the new and improved, Sally: The Weather Bot (on the web).

## More Information
- [Config File](./README.md)

## IMPROVED FEATURES FOR THE BOT
- Our cool bot Sally will detect the language you are using to communicate with the bot, and will translate parts of your sentence to any desirable langugage. Say Spanish. Cool isn't it?

- Google News Feed feature will give users the option to select their choice of country, topic, and language to give certain number of feeds. Sally will first detect the word 'news' in the message user provides, and then display a cool dropdown box which will have few options for the feed.

- API used:
- GoogleTrans, Gclientnews
