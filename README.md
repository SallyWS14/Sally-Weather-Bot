Provides you with accurate weather data on demand.

## What's new?

- We've upgraded our system to now work on the web. The backend runs on python and the frontennd runs on html5 and javascript.
- You can now properly communicate with the system. Say good bye to that robotic feelings of /command and hello to the new and improved, Sally: The Weather Bot (on the web).

## More Information

- [UPDATED README (readme1.md)](./README1.md)

## New features:

* Google map image:
  * Using the google static map api, I managed to have bot be triggered by specific words such as map or map-image to put out a google map image of where the person is (using their ip address and geocoding/reverse geocoding)
* Google street view:
  * Using the google street view image api, I managed to have the bot be triggered by words such as street to put out an street image of google map's street view on the person's location.
